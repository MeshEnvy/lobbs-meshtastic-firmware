# LoBBS Internals

[https://discord.gg/DMrGcGQfMN](https://discord.gg/DMrGcGQfMN)

Player commands are in the [daily user guide](lobbs-daily.md). The machine wire format is in the [Machine API](lobbs-machine.md). Why plugins work the way they do, how to define your own hooks, and the new-app checklist are in the [plugin author's guide](lobbs-plugins.md).

## Request flow

1. A DM line starting with `/` may include an optional request id (`/42 mail list`).
2. Page-only verbs (`/p2`, `/p 2`, `/43 p2`) load the cached `LoBBSResponse` for that sender and render a page.
3. Otherwise `slash_cmd` runs. Each plugin compares the verb and returns quietly when it is not the owner.
4. Handlers build a `LoBBSResponse` and call `lobbsCommandReplyResponse`. Successful replies are cached, then page 1 is rendered.
5. Without a request id, plain text uses `{p n/t}` footers. With an id, machine replies use `<id>ok [n:max]`.

There is no central unknown-command reply. If no module owns the verb, the node stays silent.

## One verb, rest untouched

After peeling `/[id]`, the registry takes one verb token and leaves the rest on `ctx.rest`.

Example: `/mail send ben this is my long message` keeps `this is my long message` intact. Mail peels `send`, then `ben`, then treats the rest as the body. Nothing re-tokenizes the whole line up front.

Handlers use `lobbsArgShift`, `lobbsArgPeek`, `lobbsArgRest`, `lobbsArgShiftUint`, `lobbsArgPeekIsUint`, and `lobbsArgShiftMany` on `ctx.rest`. Do not use partial `atoi` on numeric tokens.

Subcommands use one `LoBBSVerb` table for dispatch (`lobbsDispatchSub`) and help (`lobbsHelpForTable`). Rows with `fn == nullptr` are help-only. `LOBBS_V_LOGIN` and `LOBBS_V_SYSOP` gate dispatch and hide sysop rows from help when the caller is not a sysop.

## Paging and reply cache

Every successful command answers with page 1 and stores the full result set in RAM for that sender's node id.

| Constant                        | Value | Role                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `LOBBS_REPLY_CACHE_TTL_SEC`     | 300   | About five minutes, reset on each page read |
| `LOBBS_REPLY_CACHE_MAX_BYTES`   | 8192  | Larger payloads are not cached              |
| `LOBBS_REPLY_CACHE_MAX_ENTRIES` | 32    | Oldest entry dropped when full              |

A new successful command replaces the cache. Errors do not change it. Over-limit payloads send page 1 and clear the cache, so `/p2` replies `No cached reply.`. Past the end: `No such page.`

Follow with `/p2` or `/43 p2` (request id optional). Plain-text serialization runs `display_human` on each record before paging.

## Help and `/hi`

`/help` with no remainder builds a topic list: built-in rows (`help`, `hi`, `pN`) plus rows from `help_topics`. Logged-in users see feature topics. Sysop-only topics follow each plugin's rules.

`/help mail` or `/help mail send` runs `help_for_topic`. The query is in `args` as `LODB_F_TITLE`. Plugins set `LODB_F_DESCRIPTION` on the value record when they recognize the query. If nothing matches, the reply is `No help found for …`.

`/hi` is a welcome screen, not the command catalog. `/status` uses `status_lines`.

## Hook bus

Source: `LoBBSHooks.h`. Modeled on WordPress actions and filters. The bus is shaped so a handler could later come from a script instead of compiled C++. Why it works this way, and how to define hooks of your own, is in the [plugin author's guide](lobbs-plugins.md).

Rules:

- Hooks are named by string, matched case-insensitively. The bus stores the name pointer, so pass a string literal. Any number of handlers, added at runtime, no cap. `lobbsHooksReset()` clears all.
- There is no list of allowed names. Firing a name nobody registered does nothing. Registering a name nobody fires is never called.
- Every hook receives `args` as a `LoScalar`. Data crosses the bus as LoScalar fields, not C++ types.
- No hook claims or short-circuits. Every handler runs.
- Priority is fixed at registration (lower first, ties keep registration order). Bands: `HELP` 0, `AUTH` 10, `FEATURE` 20, `STATUS` 30, `TIME` 31. Install registers at `AUTH - 1`.
- A handler registered with the wrong kind for a name is logged and skipped.
- Handlers talk only through `ctx`, `args`, and the value. No handler calls another plugin.

Three kinds:

- Action: `(ctx, args)`, fire and forget.
- Record filter: `(ctx, LoScalar &value, args)`. Caller seeds `value`, each handler edits it or leaves it.
- List filter: `(ctx, std::vector<LoScalar> &value, args)`. Same, over a list.

| Hook              | Kind   | Initial value          | args                                             | Role                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `slash_cmd`       | action | n/a                    | verb (`LOBBS_ARG_VERB`), rest (`LOBBS_ARG_REST`) | Compare with `lobbsSlashVerbIs`, parse `ctx->rest`                                 |
| `seed`            | action | n/a                    | empty                                            | Demo and test builds (`LOBBS_SEED`). Each app seeds its tables                     |
| `help_topics`     | list   | built-in topics        | empty                                            | Append `{title, description}` rows                                                 |
| `help_for_topic`  | record | title = topic          | title = query                                    | Set description when the topic matches                                             |
| `status_lines`    | list   | empty                  | empty                                            | Append `{title, description}` (`Users` / `12 total` renders as `Users (12 total)`) |
| `display_human`   | record | generic title line     | source record                                    | Rewrite title for records you recognize                                            |
| `config_keys`     | list   | empty                  | empty                                            | Append key definition rows (`default`, `min`, `max` in fields 0–2)                 |
| `config_validate` | record | title = key, 0 = value | key definition record                            | Set `LODB_F_ERROR` to reject; empty means ok                                       |
| `config_changed`  | action | n/a                    | title = key, field 0 = effective value           | Apply new settings after set, reset, or database open                              |

These are the hooks core and the bundled apps fire. Apps add their own names the same way.

Something happened: action. Contribute to one shared value: record filter. Contribute to a shared list: list filter. A new need gets a new hook name, not a new kind.

## Result sets and rendering

Handlers build `LoBBSResponse` (`ok`, `error`, `records`) with `lobbsRecordPush`, `lobbsResponseAppendRecord`, or `lobbsResponseSetError`, then call `lobbsCommandReplyResponse`. `lobbsCommandReply` and `lobbsCommandReplyError` wrap it. Handlers never page.

Human: generic `title (description)` per record, then `display_human`, packed into 200 bytes with `{p n/t}`.

Machine: records encoded as LoScalar lines, sliced into pages with `<id>ok [n:max]`. See the Machine API guide.

`lobbsMsgRegisterDisplay()` (wireup) registers one `display_human` handler for mail and news list and read rows. Mail and news command modules do not register their own `display_human` filters.

## LoFS and install

LoFS exposes `/` as a virtual root listing mounts. Writable paths start with `/<mount>/…` (`flash`, optional `sd`, optional `extra` when built with `LOBBS_EXTRA_QSPI=1`). Mount roots cannot be removed, renamed, or used as copy sources. Cross-mount `mv` copies files then deletes the source. Directories require same-mount rename.

Install marker: `/flash/lobbs.ls`, field `LOBBS_INSTALL_FIELD_ROOT` holds the database root (e.g. `/flash`).

| State   | Behavior                                                         |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blank   | Only `/help` and `/install`. Other commands get the install hint |
| Ready   | Marker mount present and `LoDb::open(root)` succeeded            |
| Offline | Marker names a missing mount. Non-help commands error            |

`/install` authorization matches admin PKI in `AdminModule` (local client or encrypted DM with a configured admin key). Only `/install` creates SysOp accounts.

## Sessions

Logins live in RAM, not LoDB: `AuthDal` holds a vector of `{nodeId, userUuid, lastActiveMs, cwd}` slots, keyed by sender node id. Slot count and idle expiry come from `session.max` and `session.idle` in the config registry (defaults 16 and 86400 s). Each lookup refreshes `lastActiveMs`. A slot idle past the expiry, or whose user row is gone, is freed on lookup. Logging in reuses the node's slot, takes a free or expired one, or evicts the longest idle. Shrinking the limit keeps the most recently active. Sessions end on reboot, and `clearSessions()` runs whenever the database opens. Logins never write flash; overrides live in the `config` table.

## Config registry

SysOp `/config` lists, reads, sets, and resets uint32 settings. Plugins declare keys on `config_keys` via `lobbsConfigPushKey`. `/help config key` replies with the key's help text, default, and range. Validation runs on `config_validate` (core registers a min/max range check at help priority). Successful sets upsert one row in table `config` (title = key); reset deletes the row so defaults cost no flash. `config_changed` fires after each set or reset and for every key when the database opens (`lobbsInstallDatabaseOpened`).

SysOp file commands, chunked upload, and path rules are documented in the [SysOp guide](lobbs-sysop.md).

## LoScalar

One record is one line of numbered fields, `number:value`, joined by `|` in ascending field order, numbers `0..99`. Values escape `\`, `|`, and newline with a backslash. Typed accessors cover strings, `uint32`, `uint64`, bools, and 32-byte keys as hex. `encode` takes a byte limit and fails rather than write past it.

```
95:1790000000|96:1790000000|97:see you at the trailhead|99:9168245037165234184
```

Why this shape:

- One format everywhere. The same line is a row on disk, a record in a `LoBBSResponse`, a hook argument, and a line in a machine reply. Nothing translates between a storage format and a wire format, and a client decodes exactly what the node stored.
- You can read it. `/cat` on a row file, or the SD card in a laptop, shows the fields as text. Debugging a node in the field needs no decoder.
- No schema compiler. A record type is a `*Records.h` header of field numbers. A new field is a new constant, with no generated code and no build step.
- Numbers instead of names. A field costs two digits and a colon, not a key name. That matters when the whole reply is 200 bytes.
- Decoding keeps every field, including numbers the reader does not know. Two apps, or a firmware and a client a release apart, can share a record without agreeing on all of it.
- Flat on purpose. There is no nesting and no quoting. A news body full of quotes needs no JSON parser. A structured value, like the wall grid, is one string field the owning app parses.
- Small. The codec is one class with no dependencies, which fits nRF52 flash and the 512-byte stack cap.

On nRF52, do not format `uint64_t` with `%llu`.

## LoDB

`LoDb::open(root)` stores tables at `<root>/lodb/<db>/<table>/`, one `<16 hex uuid>.ls` file per row. Writes go to `<path>.w` then rename. API: `registerTable`, `insert`, `get`, `update`, `upsert`, `deleteRecord`, `select`, `count`. Row cap `LODB_MAX_RECORD_BYTES` (1024). Uuid from `lodb_new_uuid`. Prefer `upsert` for keyed or singleton rows. Runtime quotas and session limits use the config registry, not per-app singleton tables.

### Field numbers

App fields use `0..93` (`LODB_F_USER_LIMIT` is 94). Each app's `*Records.h` is the schema. System fields count down from 99.

| Number | Name                 | Who writes it                    |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 99     | `LODB_F_ID`          | LoDB, the row uuid               |
| 98     | `LODB_F_TITLE`       | The app. Human renderer line     |
| 97     | `LODB_F_DESCRIPTION` | The app. Mail, news, yarn bodies |
| 96     | `LODB_F_CREATED`     | LoDB unless set. Unix seconds    |
| 94     | `LODB_F_ERROR`       | Any filter. User-facing error    |
| 95     | `LODB_F_UPDATED`     | LoDB unless set. Unix seconds    |

Strip 95 and 96 before `update` to get default stamps. Times are Unix seconds, not milliseconds.

## Stack budget

`LoBBSStackGuard.h`: on nRF52 every LoBBS function is capped at 512 bytes of stack (`-Wstack-usage=512` as an error). Commands run on the 4 KB loop task shared with the router. Include the guard last in every LoBBS `.cpp`. Keep large buffers off the stack.

## Verifying

Build `pio run -e rak4631` and run `trunk fmt` before commit. Native tests are not green on this branch. See `.cursor/rules/lobbs-verification.mdc`.
