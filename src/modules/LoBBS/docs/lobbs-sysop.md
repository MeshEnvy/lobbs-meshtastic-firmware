# LoBBS SysOp Guide

[https://discord.gg/DMrGcGQfMN](https://discord.gg/DMrGcGQfMN)

If you run a LoBBS node, you are the System Operator (SysOp) and this guide is for you.

Normal player commands are in the [daily user guide](lobbs-daily.md).

## Install

[Install on MeshForge](https://meshforge.org/MeshEnvy/lobbs-meshtastic-firmware) or compile and flash from source.

A new LoBBS node has no database until you install it. Only `/help` and `/install` work until then. The install hint lists the mounts this hardware can hold a database on:

| Hardware                 | Install mounts                                       |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| nRF52840                 | `sd`, `extra`, `flash2` (100 KB set aside for LoBBS) |
| ESP32 and other hardware | `sd`, `extra`, `flash`                               |

Mounts are listed in preference order. `sd` appears when a card is present. `extra` (about 2 MB) appears on Seeed XIAO nRF52840 kit and SenseCAP Solar Node builds (`LOBBS_EXTRA_QSPI=1`). On nRF52840 `/flash` is Meshtastic's own 28 KB and is not offered.

`/install <mount> <user> <pass>` creates the database on that mount and makes `<user>` the SysOp. Use it from the local client (phone app connected over serial/BLE) or from a remote DM encrypted with a configured admin key. If the target already holds a LoBBS database, the same command adopts it and you must supply an existing SysOp username and password.

The choice is stored in `/flash/lobbs.ls`. If that mount is missing on a later boot, every command fails with an offline message until the hardware is fixed or you delete the marker and reinstall. If Meshtastic wipes `/flash`, the node shows as new. `/install <mount>` with your SysOp login picks the database back up.

## Demo builds

Add `-D LOBBS_DEMO_MODE` to `build_flags` (or `PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS="-D LOBBS_DEMO_MODE" pio run -e <env>`) to wipe `lodb/lobbs` on the first install mount every boot and seed demo data. Accounts: `sysop` and `demo01` through `demo12`, password `demo1`. Sample mail, news, wall paint, and yarn text are included for paging tests.

## SysOp commands

SysOp-only lines reply `SysOp only.` to everyone else.

Config keys (uint32, defaults in parentheses): `session.max` (16), `session.idle` (86400 s), `wall.period` (3600), `wall.cells` (1), `yarn.period` (3600), `yarn.words` (1), `yarn.chars` (32), `pager.ttl` (300), `password.min` (5). Run `/config` with no args to list current values and ranges. `/help config key` explains one setting.

| `/rm /path`                 | Delete a file (absolute path only)                                                             |

| `/commit src dst`           | Move when file CRC32 matches the 8-hex segment in the source name                              |

SysOps painting the wall or adding yarn do not use quota.

## Files

Paths use mount prefixes: `/flash/...`, `/flash2/...` on nRF52840, `/sd/...`, `/extra/...` on builds with `LOBBS_EXTRA_QSPI=1` and a QSPI flash chip. `/` lists mounts. Do not `/rmtree` `<mount>/lodb` on your install mount unless you intend to wipe the BBS.

`/flash` is shared with Meshtastic's own settings and node database. LoBBS leaves a reserve free there (16 KB on nRF52, 128 KB elsewhere). Posts, mail, uploads, and copies that would cut into it reply `Disk full.`. Deleting files always works. `/flash2`, `/sd` and `/extra` have no reserve.

Relative paths work under your session working directory for `ls`, `cat`, `hex`, `stat`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `upload`, and `commit`. `rm`, `rmdir`, and `rmtree` require absolute paths.

## Chunked upload

`/upload path offset:b62` writes base62-decoded bytes at `offset`. `/upload path` with no offset replies with the current size. `/commit src dst` verifies CRC32 from the source filename before replacing the destination.

From the firmware repo root:

```bash
python src/modules/LoBBS/bin/lobbs_chunkify.py local.txt /flash/path/dest.txt
```

The script prints `/mkdir`, `/upload`, and `/commit` lines. Temp files use `<name>.<crc8>.tmp`.
