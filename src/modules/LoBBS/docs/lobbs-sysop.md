# LoBBS SysOp Guide

[https://discord.gg/DMrGcGQfMN](https://discord.gg/DMrGcGQfMN)

If you run a LoBBS node, you are the System Operator (SysOp) and this guide is for you.

Normal player commands are in the [daily user guide](lobbs-daily.md).

## Install

[Install on MeshForge](https://meshforge.org/MeshEnvy/lobbs-meshtastic-firmware) or compile and flash from source.

A new LoBBS node has no database until you install it. Only `/help` and `/install` work until then. The install hint lists mounts that are present on this hardware (`flash`, plus `sd` when a card is present and `extra` on builds with `LOBBS_EXTRA_QSPI=1`).

`/install <flash|extra|sd> <user> <pass>` creates the database on that mount and makes `<user>` the SysOp. Use it from the local client (phone app connected over serial/BLE) or from a remote DM encrypted with a configured admin key. If the target already holds a LoBBS database, the same command adopts it and you must supply an existing SysOp username and password.

The choice is stored in `/flash/lobbs.ls`. If that mount is missing on a later boot, every command fails with an offline message until the hardware is fixed or you delete the marker and reinstall.

## Demo builds

Add `-D LOBBS_DEMO_MODE` to `build_flags` (or `PLATFORMIO_BUILD_FLAGS="-D LOBBS_DEMO_MODE" pio run -e <env>`) to wipe `/flash/lodb/lobbs` on every boot and seed demo data. Accounts: `sysop` and `demo01` through `demo12`, password `demo1`. Sample mail, news, wall paint, and yarn text are included for paging tests.

## SysOp commands

SysOp-only lines reply `SysOp only.` to everyone else.

Config keys (uint32, defaults in parentheses): `session.max` (16), `session.idle` (86400 s), `wall.period` (3600), `wall.cells` (1), `yarn.period` (3600), `yarn.words` (1), `yarn.chars` (32), `pager.ttl` (300), `password.min` (5). Run `/config` with no args to list current values and ranges.

SysOps painting the wall or adding yarn do not use quota.

## Files

Paths use mount prefixes: `/flash/...`, `/sd/...`, `/extra/...` on builds with `LOBBS_EXTRA_QSPI=1` and a QSPI flash chip. `/` lists mounts. Do not `/rmtree` `/flash/lodb` unless you intend to wipe the BBS.

Relative paths work under your session working directory for `ls`, `cat`, `hex`, `stat`, `mkdir`, `cp`, `mv`, `upload`, and `commit`. `rm`, `rmdir`, and `rmtree` require absolute paths.

## Chunked upload

`/upload path offset:b62` writes base62-decoded bytes at `offset`. `/upload path` with no offset replies with the current size. `/commit src dst` verifies CRC32 from the source filename before replacing the destination.

From the firmware repo root:

```bash
python src/modules/LoBBS/bin/lobbs_chunkify.py local.txt /flash/path/dest.txt
```

The script prints `/mkdir`, `/upload`, and `/commit` lines. Temp files use `<name>.<crc8>.tmp`.
