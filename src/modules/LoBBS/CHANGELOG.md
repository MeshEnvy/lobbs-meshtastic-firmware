# Changelog

LoBBS product history for [lobbs-meshtastic-firmware](https://github.com/MeshEnvy/lobbs-meshtastic-firmware). Meshtastic upstream release notes live in [meshtastic/firmware](https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware); the `[VERSION]` section in `version.properties` tracks that base.

LoBBS semver is the `[LOBBS]` section in `version.properties` when present. Builds inject `LOBBS_VERSION` / `LOBBS_VERSION_SHORT` (see repo root `bin/readprops.py`, `bin/platformio-custom.py`). Until LoBBS 2.0.0 ships, dev builds may show a pre-release `[LOBBS]` value on branch `lobbs`.

Release tags use:

`lobbs-{lobbsSemVer}.{lobbsSha7}-meshtastic-{mtSemVer}.{mtSha7}`

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

Planned major release **2.0.0** (not tagged yet).

### Added

- Stateless slash CLI: `/[id] command args…`, replies optionally prefixed `<id>`. No menu stack. The last successful reply is cached for `/pN` paging.
- Plugin command IoC: Auth, Mail, News, Help, Status, Wall, Yarn apps register via filters.
- Long replies page with `/p2`, `/p3`, … against the cached last reply, with or without a request id.
- `/wall`: shared 12×12 ASCII canvas, batch paint, erase tokens, paint quota, new/seen on `/status` when logged in.
- `/news`: announcement feed (list, read, post, unread, sysop delete).
- `/yarn`: collaborative word tail and sysop quotas.
- Public `/status` and `/hi`; all-time totals when logged out; unread mail/news when logged in.
- Machine replies echo the request id and mark pages separately: `<id>ok [n:max]` (single-page replies are `<id>ok`).
- SysOp `/cd` and `/pwd`: per-session working directory for `/ls`, `/cat` and `/hex`. `/rm`, `/rmdir` and `/rmtree` take absolute paths only.
- LoFS mount table (`/flash`, optional `/sd` and `/extra`), virtual `/`, `/install` blank-node setup, and SysOp `/cp`, `/mv`, `/mkdir`, `/stat`, `/df`.
- SysOp chunked upload: `/upload` (offset base62 chunks) and CRC-checked `/commit`; host script [bin/lobbs_chunkify.py](bin/lobbs_chunkify.py).
- `/passwd` (self and sysop reset) and `/time` (show Unix time; sysop set clock).
- Logins are held in RAM and end on reboot or after an idle timeout. SysOp `/config` sets `session.max`, `session.idle`, wall/yarn quotas, `pager.ttl`, and `password.min`. `/help config key` explains a setting. Overrides live in one LoDB `config` table. Logging in never writes flash.
- Ignore non-slash DMs and self-originated loopback (`from` = local node).

### Changed

- LoFS: cross-mount `move`, streaming `crc32File`, and `moveIfCrc32Matches`; glob helpers in `lofs/Glob`. FsCommands maps results to CLI replies; upload gap check unchanged in `/upload`.
- Operator role renamed from admin to SysOp in CLI text, help, and user records (`is_sysop` in auth proto, field 4 unchanged).
- LoBBS protos and DALs split into per-app modules; LoDB hardening for nRF52.
- `/login` for sign-in; build-time LoBBS versioning from `version.properties`.
- Topic commands for mail, news, and users (development on branch; superseded by stateless CLI for 2.0.0).

### Removed

- Numbered menu stack and session page buffer from the shipping 2.0.0 line (experimental on branch only).
